## Contributing to smartsheet java sdk

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-java-sdk/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-java-sdk/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **[MRE code sample](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. If possible please also note if this issue concerns the API itself or just the java sdk.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* A maintainer should review your PR within the next few days. If the PR has been dormant for more than a week, consider sending an email to sdk-java@smartsheet.com 

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability may take longer to review, but are still welcome.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change as an issue with the label #enhancement. Make sure that your new feature description outlines why this would be helpful for users, and how difficult a change it would be to make.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code or using the SDK?**

* For general information on the API and it's uses, see the [Smartsheet API Reference](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/)

* For information on the Java sdk, see the [Smartsheet Java SDK API](https://smartsheet.github.io/smartsheet-java-sdk/apidocs/) or review the [basic](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-java-sdk#readme) and [advanced](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-java-sdk/blob/mainline/ADVANCED.md) READMEs!
