/**

 * to Smartsheet REST API.
 * <p>
 * It defines two abstract methods ("id" getter and setter) and annotates them as @JsonIgnore and @JsonProperty
 * respectively.
 * <p>
 * It is a static private inner class of JacksonJsonSerializer class.

 * Thread Safety: This class is thread safe since it's immutable.
